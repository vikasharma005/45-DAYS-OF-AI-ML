The series starts with 0 and 1, and then each subsequent number is the sum of the two previous numbers. The Fibonacci series typically begins as follows:\n","```\n","0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...\n","```\n","\n","The general formula for generating the Fibonacci series is:\n","\n","```\n","F(0) = 0\n","F(1) = 1\n","F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n > 1\n","```\n","\n","Here, F(n) represents the nth term in the Fibonacci series.\n","\n","\n","**Explanation of the Python Program:**\n","\n","1. The program defines a function `fibonacci_series(n)` that takes an integer `n` as input, which represents the number of terms to be printed in the Fibonacci series.\n","\n","2. In the function, we first check if `n` is less than or equal to 0. If it is, we print an error message and return, as we cannot generate a Fibonacci series with non-positive or zero terms.\n","\n","3. Next, we initialize two variables `a` and `b` to 0 and 1, respectively. These variables represent the first two terms of the series.\n","\n","4. We use a `while` loop to print the Fibonacci series up to the desired number of terms (`n`). Inside the loop, we print the current value of `a` and then calculate the next term (`nth`) by adding `a` and `b`. We update `a` to the value of `b`, and `b` to the value of `nth`.\n","\n","5. The loop continues until the desired number of terms are printed (`count` becomes equal to `n`).\n","\n","6. In the `__main__` section, we prompt the user to enter the number of terms they want in the Fibonacci series.

It takes two arguments: `text` (the input text to be encrypted or decrypted) and `shift` (the constant shift value used for encryption or decryption).\n","\n","1. The `result` variable is initialized as an empty string. This variable will store the final encrypted or decrypted text.\n","\n","2. The function iterates through each character in the input `text`.\n","\n","3. It checks if the character is printable and not a space. Characters like special characters, numbers, and alphabets are included for encryption and decryption. Spaces are excluded to preserve spacing in the text.\n","\n","4. If the character meets the criteria, it performs the following operations:\n","\n","   a. Sets `base` to the ASCII value of the first printable character, which is space (' '). This is done to map the character range from space (' ') to tilde ('~') in ASCII, which includes all printable characters.\n","\n","   b. Sets `total_chars` to 95, representing the total number of printable characters in ASCII, from space (' ') to tilde ('~').\n","\n","   c. Calculates the ASCII value of the shifted character using the formula `(ord(char) - base + shift) % total_chars + base`.\n","\n","   d. Converts the ASCII value back to a character using `chr` and adds it to the `result` string.\n","\n","5. If the character is not printable or a space, it directly adds it to the `result` string.\n","\n","6. After iterating through all characters in the input `text`, the `result` string contains the encrypted or decrypted text, which is then returned.\n","\n","### `main` Function\n","\n","The `main` function is the entry point of the program and allows the user to choose between encryption and decryption.\n","\n","1. It starts by defining the constant `shift` value, which determines the level of encryption or decryption.\n","\n","2. The user is prompted to enter their choice (encryption or decryption) by inputting 'E' or 'D', respectively.\n","\n","3. Based on the user's choice, the program takes the input text from the user and calls the `caesar_cipher` function with the appropriate shift value to perform encryption or decryption.\n","\n","4.

For each `inst` (rectangle instance), we create a `fitz.Rect` object called `rect`.
