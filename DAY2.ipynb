The user-provided element is then appended to the `new_list` using the `append()` method.\n","\n","7. Once all elements are added to the `new_list`, the function appends the entire `new_list` to the main `lists` list, effectively adding the current list to the list of lists.\n","\n","8. The `count` is then incremented by 1 to move on to the next list.\n","\n","9. The loop continues until `count` becomes 5, creating all five lists.\n","\n","10.
